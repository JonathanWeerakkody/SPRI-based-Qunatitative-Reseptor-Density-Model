# SPRI-based-Qunatitative-Reseptor-Density-Model
The SPRI-based quantitative receptor density model estimates peptide density immobilized on gold surfaces by analyzing changes in reflectivity and refractive index sensitivity. Using a numerical approach, it approximates receptor density while accounting for environmental factors, optimizing peptide interactions for gas-phase biomimetic sensing.
